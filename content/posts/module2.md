I am early on in the program, much of it is concerned with learning how to use various digital tools.

What is Autism?

What Is Autism? | Autism Speaks

Autism is a developmental disorder that is very difficult to reduce to a common factor - each person diagnosed as autistic is as different to one another as to anyone else. Commonly children who are on the autism spectrum exhibit a range of issues with social interaction, repetitive behavior, and hyper-emotional reactions to particular stimuli. Autism can be diagnosed as early as 18 months, and the particular challenges of each child must be tackled with customized interventions.

The CDC sorts the treatments for autism into 7 categories: 

Behavioral

Developmental

Educational

Social-Relational

Pharmacological

Psychological

Complementary and Alternative

These treatments are mostly instructional, occurring in a classroom (or clinical) setting. Technology can be helpful in some cases; many autistic children have problems recognizing the emotional state of others, software can help them learn how to study other people's faces to gauge how they are feeling. Face Say is a piece of software which provides an interactive game where children can practice the skill of face-reading.

Many autistic people have difficulty with daily tasks, or more specifically the slight changes that can occur day-to-day, so they require some extra encouragement to fight through their natural inclination to resist change and just get on with life. Otsimo is a useful piece of software that can help them face these challenges on an iPad, and then be ready for it in the real world.

Since so many autistic children feel isolated because of their difficulty in dealing with social situations, one company has made a series of Bluetooth enabled stuffed animals that can interact with software to sing songs and tell stories. The BlueBee Pals provide an app that can help teach children on the autism spectrum how to handle social situations, and do so with a plush friend. My oldest son is autistic, and I will definitely try to find one of these for him.

One group of caring parents and educators has created a series of comics and books for telling stories carefully targeted at autistic children. Geek Club Books is a very cute, free, and thoughtful series of free documents created for children to help them through the pitfalls of their daily life.

Because of my child I am mostly focused here (and daily) on what an autistic child needs, but what about an adult. I found the following resource called Autistic Grown Up, which provides free toolkits for adults to help themselves function in a pro-social way. This looks like a fantastic resource, I am not very familiar with it but from the looks of it, these people are really trying to give every a hand-up.

This is not an exhaustive list of assistive technologies for people on the autism spectrum. More low-tech technologies like visual schedules, icon based instructions, and strategically placed velcro or snaps (for clothing) can help children with various types of autism. As I mentioned, autism has a range of symptoms, and none of these technologies is a palliative for all. Autism Parenting Magazine has a wide range of articles on various ways of helping children with autism. When I look at it, there are many assistive technologies that I do not think would be helpful for my son Avram, but it is remarkable how many simple things can be done that will help him make sense of the world.
