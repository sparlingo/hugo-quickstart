## Academic Article

My main goal for the first 2 months of academic year 2023-2024, are to become better at classroom management. One of the names that constantly comes up when I ask my fellow teachers is the work of Robert Marzano, an American educational researcher. I am providing a link here to the Marzano Teacher Evaluation Model, something that I have been reading recently and will provide me with a way to evaluate my own performance in the future. This model includes four domains:

1. Classroom Strategies and Behaviors
2. Planning and Preparing
3. Reflecting on Teaching
4. Collegiality and Professionalism

This model is very comprehensive, and realistically I will not be able to apply it at all times. But it has a number of different elements that researchers have shown increase student engagement provide desireable learning outcomes. I will keep this handy throughout the new school year, and try my best to gauge my own progress.

## Professional development

I have to admit it: I am not a well organized person. I want to change this. Having more time next year will help, but I need a framework. I am taking this course over my summer break - [Coursera: Get Organized, How to be a Together Teacher](https://www.coursera.org/learn/together-teacher/home/welcome).

Near the end of the year I was overwhelmed by a number of different demands on my time, and I decided that I need a system for managing my time. I only have so much bandwith, and I need to setup some systems for myself that just keep rolling through the year and do not require a great deal of thought from me.

## Student Scavanger Hunt

I totally spaced on this portion. There was one thing that I worked on very carefully with my students though throughout my time with them - how to handle losing. We play a "sport" at QSI called Gagaball. The details about how the sport are played are not important, but what is important is that it is a crazy game, and we almost always finished second. We won one mini-tournament, we finished third once, but every other time we were second. 

Why does this matter? I know something about the correct mindset for sports, actually I wish I applied it more widely in my own life. The way I would say it is this: keep your focus on what you can effect! Don't worry about what other people are doing, just keep going until the game is over. 

My group was obsessed with fairness, it was their guiding light. Sports are not always fair, but if we are honest we all cheat a little. We just need to play as hard as we can within the rules. Bend them but don't break them. 

I was proud of a second place finish, and I think I got through to some of them at least.

## My Cohort

## Shared hobby

One of my main hobbies for years has been Ultimate Frisbee. I injured my knee around April 2022, so I have not been playing much lately. I have been feeling better this year, so I am getting back to it. I am going to spearheading getting some of the teachers at QSI into Ultimate, and we did one session before school ended. I swear I did it, but I did not get a picture. Sorry!

## Social Media

I do not have a Twitter account, and my Facebook account is as dead as disco. So, I will try to say something to the point here. 

*If you are teaching without a license, get one! This is the best way to become a "real" teacher, and then no one can stop you except yourself*

## My biggest achievement

My biggest achievement during the whole Moreland program was managing my own emotions. Honestly, I have been working A LOT for a long time. I have not left China since Covid started, and my wife and I have had two young children in that time. I AM TIRED! I have to constantly try and put myself outside of myself so that I can judge my own behavior. Sometimes it is good, sometimes it has not been good. I put myself through something in the last 2 years or so, Moreland was a part of that. Now with the kids, I have to strive, strive, strive. I feel like I have accomplished something.

## Personal Ethic

I am going to steal a quote now from a hero of mine - Noam Chomsky.

*"Education must provide the opportunities for self-fulfillment; it can at best provide a rich and challenging environment for the individual to explore, in his own way."*
