# Project Based Learning

#### Describe your plan for what data you will gather throughout your PBL at various checkpoints, as well as how you will use this data to inform instruction.
1.	How will you monitor the student project? What data will you collect and how often?

The students have the option to conduct this project through either PowerPoint or Google Slides. In either case they are working on a digital product that I will have access to throughout the process. The slides are easy to count, and since they are keeping the rubric at hand, writing the PP or Google Slides slide number next to each TSW (goal). 

2.	How will you provide feedback throughout the project-based unit? Keep in mind that this feedback is meant to keep students on task and working toward their goals.

I have informed the students that I will print and comment on the slides that require revision and help them what can be improved or what must be changed. The completed material depends on research from websites that I have given them, so I can easily check anything factual.

3.	How would you form groups to monitor and re-teach students who are struggling overall?

They are in small groups for this project and will complete the slides as a group, if they do not have either the background knowledge or the ability to research and create a meaningful representation of the required knowledge – then I will try my best to provide some supplementary material during the class to get them on track. There will be summative assessments each third class in the form of a Kahoot that provides the students on information about the relevant TSWs and provides me with information about who lacks knowledge in a particular area. I will pull these students aside in the next lesson and provide a supplementary mini lesson, after which they can re-join their groups.

4.	How would you form groups to monitor and re-teach or challenge students who are not engaged?

I have put these groups together in a heterogenous way, with one student who I feel has a superior level of background knowledge/English ability, one who is moderate level, and one who has an emerging level. I will encourage the student (in each group) who has the emerging level of knowledge to be the “recorder”, meaning that he/she will be the one mainly responsible for entering information into their slides while the other two do the research and study.
 
5.	How would you form groups to monitor and re-teach or challenge students who are doing well in one area but not another?

From the summative assessments (Kahoot) I should be able to select students in a granular way – students who understand one subset of the required knowledge but not another. The groups that the students are in are ones that they are regularly grouped into, and I believe they work well enough for most activities. 

6.	How would you form groups to monitor and challenge students who need to be challenged?

Groups are heterogenous, and the children with greater ability should be able to encourage ones with lower ability. My focus on this unit will be on keeping students busy. The students who tend to shirk doing their work will be held responsible for the entire group via a weekly short form where students can rank the work ethic of their group members. A happy face for your group members who are working hard, a neutral face for those doing OK, a sad face for those who are not helping the group.

7.	Develop a plan for what other students in the class will be doing while you work in the above-described small groups to re-teach or extend the lesson during the project. Give specific examples of activities you will use.

I have setup accounts for the website storyboardthat.com. While I am re-teaching a subset of students, I will have the other students produce storyboards that can be used in their presentation. These storyboards allow students to produce images that include people in familiar situations with speech balloons – students can use this to produce images that say what the students want to say about the relevant TSWs.

8.	Provide an analysis of what is necessary to reteach and review before moving onto the next unit.

After viewing the presentations, I can make a judgement about what is necessary to re-teach. I have my own master presentation that I created on ahaslides.com, which is a presentation app that allows the students to interact with the slides and vote on the questions provided. If I get good results for topics, then those will not require re-teaching. Along with the regular Kahoots I should be receiving enough information throughout the project that tells me how the students understand the material.

9.	How will you provide remediation and extension once the project is completed?

I hope that as I observe the groups’ progress throughout the process that remediation will not be necessary. If the students cannot provide meaningful material on any of the required knowledge, then I will stay ahead of this and provide some supplementary material (video, article, encyclopedia entry) to elucidate the elements that are lacking. 

10.	Develop a plan for what other students in the class will be doing while you work in small groups to re-teach or extend the lesson after the project. Give specific examples of activities you will use.

My school is a mastery school, students do not have to be working on the same academic unit at the same time. Each student has work that they can complete for either enrichment or remediation, I can plan for this easily and keep the other students busy while I am occupied with the others. We have ready access to iPads, where each student has access to targeted exercises in Math and/or English. Further we keep a Reading Unit open for the entire year, each student has material there that they can access at any time and complete when asked.




# Reflections on Diagnostic Assessment for Differentiation

I have recently moved to a new school, and this school is a mastery school. I did not know anything about the principle before I began, but it is a big part of my work life now. Differentiation is a huge part of mastery learning, and diagnostic assessment is a key to pulling it off effectively. I am now starting my academic units with a pre-assessment, and the data from this is valuable for multiple reasons. Here I will outline my thoughts about this, from both my recent work experience and our VC from the previous week.

### Pre-assessment - is it for me?

One of the most obvious reasons to do a pre-assessment of student knowledge is to make my job, simply, easier. If my task is to get students from one level of knowledge to another, then starting with some knowledge about what they already know might allow me to not waste everyone’s time. When I recently started a new math unit for my Grade 4 students, I gave them a Quizizz “game” that gave me great data. This data I parsed in two ways: by question and by student. Students who did well will probably not need extra IXL or SplashLearn (online tools) work assigned, students who did less well probably will. Also, I can see from this assessment that certain questions were answered well overall, so that material does not need to be a main focus. The questions there were not answered well overall - they will need some special care and now I know that while I am planning my lessons. I am now working towards setting up math centers, where I will form homogeneous groups to meet all the students where they are. A win 
for me, and a win for them.

### Pre-assessment - is it for them?

This also seems obvious, and of course the answer is yes. We as teachers are responsible for creating plans that will facilitate learning, and delivering what we think is best. They can only learn what we put in front of them. A common theme throughout what we have learned at Moreland is that the days of one lesson for everyone, and all the students having to fit themselves to the lessons should be over. If we have constant data about what students know and what is the next lesson for them, and we are thoughtful about how we set up our materials and guidance then we can have something for everyone. I am attempting to plan from now on by using backwards lesson design, as outlined here: Where to Start: Backward Design | Teaching + Learning Lab (mit.edu). I want my students to produce evidence of their learning, and for that learning to be measurable and specific. I have thought deeply about this lately, as since I have started my new job I have not provided goals that are attainable or clear in some of my classes. Goals for lessons/units should be student centered, and if I do not know enough about what students can already do - then it will be difficult or impossible to design goals for them that are achievable. 

I will be using more diagnostic assessments as part of the process from now on. Formative assessments, pre-assessment, and keeping a focus on the skills that students should demonstrate after the lesson will be my focus. If I can align my lessons with the evaluation, and provide appropriate feedback then my students should master the content with a reasonable effort level.
