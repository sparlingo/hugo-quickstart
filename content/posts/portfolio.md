## Academic Article

My main goal for the first 2 months of academic year 2023-2024, are to become better at classroom management. One of the names that constantly comes up when I ask my fellow teachers is the work of Robert Marzano, an American educational researcher. I am providing a link here to the Marzano Teacher Evaluation Model, something that I have been reading recently and will provide me with a way to evaluate my own performance in the future. This model includes four domains:

1. Classroom Strategies and Behaviors
2. Planning and Preparing
3. Reflecting on Teaching
4. Collegiality and Professionalism

This model is very comprehensive, and realistically I will not be able to apply it at all times. But it has a number of different elements that researchers have shown increase student engagement provide desireable learning outcomes. I will keep this handy throughout the new school year, and try my best to gauge my own progress.

## Professional development

I have to admit it: I am not a well organized person. I want to change this. Having more time next year will help, but I need a framework. I am taking this course over my summer break - [Coursera: Get Organized, How to be a Together Teacher](https://www.coursera.org/learn/together-teacher/home/welcome).

Near the end of the year I was overwhelmed by a number of different demands on my time, and I decided that I need a system for managing my time. I only have so much bandwith, and I need to setup some systems for myself that just keep rolling through the year and do not require a great deal of thought from me.

## Shared hobby

One of my main hobbies for years has been Ultimate Frisbee. I injured my knee around April 2022, so I have not been playing much lately. I have been feeling better this year, so I am getting back to it. I am going to spearheading getting some of the teachers at QSI into Ultimate, and we did one session before school ended. 

## Social Media

## My biggest achievement

My biggest achievement during the whole Moreland program was managing my own emotions. Honestly, I have been working A LOT for a long time. All the way through Covid, I have been in China

## Personal Ethic
