# Standards for clinical practice
Moreland University candidates are evaluated by 10 standards, these are the InTASC standards. I wrote about my understanding of what these standards are here: 

### InTASC Standard 1: Learner Development
The candidate understands how learners grow and develop, recognizing that patterns of learning and development vary individually within and across the cognitive, linguistic, social, emotional, and physical areas, and designs and implements developmentally appropriate and challenging learning experiences. 

Students have different abilities, sensitivities and interests. We are there to encourage them when they need it, and to provide discipline when they need that. Teachers need to have a deep understanding of how their learners perceive things and how they are changing with time. Different learners need different types of help, and there needs to be a constant adjustment to best suit who the learner is now.

### InTASC Standard 2: Learning Differences
The candidate uses understanding of individual differences, diverse cultures and communities to ensure inclusive learning environments that enable each learner to meet high standards.

Students have different strengths and abilities, and we should give them the ability to demonstrate their learning in multiple ways. I teach in an international school and we have six different passports in the class, so they have the further gap of not just learning style but also background culture. We should take the chance to touch on many different cultural aspects from a variety of cultures, in order to see that opinions are diverse and there is not just one way of seeing things. 

### InTASC Standard 3: Learning Environments
The candidate works with others to create environments that support individual and collaborative learning, and that encourage positive social interaction, active engagement in learning, and self-motivation.

I heard it said that "good teachers manage behavior, great teachers manage the classroom". This is one of the most important standards for me to improve upon, setting up norms and understanding how your physical space works is very important for making learning easy. Since there are only two ways to get someone to do something, either to force them or have them do it out of their own desire, you want your classroom to encourage the second one. Teachers with experience that the norms that you set, how the classroom is setup, and how you conduct yourself greatly shape how classes proceed as a group.

### InTASC Standard 4: Content Knowledge
The candidate understands the central concepts, tools of inquiry, and structures of the discipline(s) s/he teaches and creates learning experiences that make these aspects of the discipline accessible and meaningful for learners to assure mastery of the content.

Teachers should be sure to keep their content knowledge up-to-date, with a through understanding of the subject matter to be taught. How can the teacher accurately transmit that knowledge to the students through their teaching? Be sure to anticipate student questions and how to best address them. I try to keep ahead of what material is going to be covered, and how I can give extra enrichment to those who need it and 

### InTASC Standard 5: Application of Content
The candidate understands how to connect concepts and use differing perspectives to engage learners in critical thinking, creativity, and collaborative problem solving related to authentic local and global issues.

Children have a natural need to enquire and create, that should be fostered by the way we present the content. Critical thinking is one of the most important 21st century skills, and rote memorization is not the way to encourage that - that is the old way of education. Things in the world are connected in very interesting ways and those nodes need to be placed out there for children to allow them to connect those nodes. Nearly everything that we present should have a collabroative aspect to it, there is very little work that children will have to do in their professional lives that is totally alone.

### InTASC Standard 6:  Assessment
The candidate understands and uses multiple methods of assessment to engage learners in their own growth, to monitor learner progress, and to guide the candidate’s and learner’s decision making.

Assessment is a key to ensure that students are learning, but it can easily become a point of stress for students. Assessments should be varied and allow students with various strengths and dispositions to demonstrate their learning in different ways. At my current school, formative assessment is not emphasized (thankfully) and there is a huge emphasis placed upon formative assessment throughout units to make sure that students are mastering the material. Formative assessments should effect how future classes proceed, and what groupings children should be placed into.

### InTASC Standard 7:  Planning for Instruction
The candidate plans instruction that supports every student in meeting rigorous learning goals by drawing upon knowledge of content areas, curriculum, cross-disciplinary skills, and pedagogy, as well as knowledge of learners and the community context.

Being prepared requires a deep understanding of the material that is to be covered, including the key concepts, skills and knowledge that the students need to master. Teachers should keep these in mind when designing units and lessons, planning how they will deliver the material in a way that reaches every students. What materials are needed to reach the objectives? And what will the assessments be? An eye should be kept to whether or not they are effectively monitoring student understanding throughout the teaching period, and what adjustments/improvements should be made. Lesson planning should be student-centered, and aligned with content standards. 
   
### InTASC Standard 8: Instructional Strategies
The candidate understands and uses a variety of instructional strategies to encourage learners to develop deep understanding of content areas and their connections, and to build skills to apply knowledge in meaningful ways.

If we have lesson plans that are well designed, if student objectives are clear and the material is well covered with meaningful practice/projects for the students to work on to show mastery of the material, then only minor-adjustments should be needed inside of a given lesson. Students may stray towards talking to friends, or to general "goofing-off", but this is normal for all students and a word (or a well-timed post-it note) should put children back on target. Student work needs to be taken at the end of lessons, checked for comprehension, and the teacher should provide feedback to the students in preparation for the next lesson. Between lessons more serious adjustment can be made to instructional strategies, whether that be how the material is presented to the students or in what they are required to do in order to show mastery.

### InTASC Standard 9: Professional Learning and Ethical Practice
The candidate engages in ongoing professional learning and uses evidence to continually evaluate his/her practice, particularly the effects of his/her choices and actions on others (learners, families, other professionals, and the community), and adapts practice to meet the needs of each learner.

Professional development should be constant for teachers, it is an easy career to get sclerotic and bored and we need to share ideas with other teachers to keep things fresh. My school has a weekly professional development program, and we have larger weekend programs that we need to participate in occasionally. We need to constantly look back through work that we have done in the past and see what worked and what could work better. Most teachers have constant communication with their co-teachers, sharing material and tips and this is not to be underestimated. We all have to be a little better every day.

### InTASC Standard 10:  Leadership and Collaboration
The candidate seeks appropriate leadership roles and opportunities to take responsibility for student learning, to collaborate with learners, families, colleagues, other school professionals, and community members to ensure learner growth, and to advance the profession.

We as teachers have a responsibility to be the authority in the classroom. Students should be given as much responsibility however as their development allows. We need to lead by example, to be the best version of ourselves because children do what they see. Giving children roles to play in the classroom is very important, they love being placed in charge of a particular aspect of the classroom and they usually rise to the occasion. Keeping up communication with the home is key, we need to be in collaboration with the parents because we all want the same thing: independent learners.
